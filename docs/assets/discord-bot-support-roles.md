# Option 1:

For a professional Discord bot support server, here's a refined color scheme that conveys authority while maintaining a sleek, tech-focused appearance:

## Trial Moderator
- **Color**: #3498db (Azure Blue)
- A professional blue that's easily visible but not overwhelming, perfect for support staff in training

## Moderator
- **Color**: #2980b9 (Strong Blue)
- A deeper blue that shows clear progression from trial status while maintaining professionalism

## Admin
- **Color**: #16a085 (Teal Green)
- Teal green projects reliability and technical competence, distinctly different from moderator blues while maintaining a professional look

## Owner
- **Color**: #8e44ad (Royal Purple)
- A refined purple that stands out as authoritative without being harsh or overly casual

This color scheme creates a professional gradient of authority that users will intuitively understand. The colors complement each other while maintaining sufficient contrast against Discord's interface.

These colors also work well if your bot has a logo or branding that you want to coordinate with. Would you like me to suggest alternatives based on your bot's color scheme?

# Option 2:

Based on your bot's beautiful cosmic logo, here's a color scheme that perfectly complements those electric blues and purples:

## Trial Moderator
- **Color**: #4ac1ff (Electric Blue)
- Matches the outer blue energy swirls of your logo, perfect for entry-level staff

## Moderator
- **Color**: #2b7fff (Deep Blue)
- A richer blue that reflects the deeper blue tones in your logo while showing clear rank progression

## Admin
- **Color**: #9966ff (Cosmic Purple)
- Pulls directly from the purple/pink energy fields in your logo, creating clear visual distinction from moderators

## Owner
- **Color**: #d580ff (Bright Violet)
- Inspired by the brightest inner parts of your cosmic swirl, making the owner immediately recognizable

This color scheme creates a natural progression through the energy colors in your logo - starting with the outer blue energies and moving toward the brighter inner core. It maintains professionalism while directly connecting to your bot's visual identity, creating a cohesive brand experience for your users.

# Option 3

Perfect! With the name "GalacticDocs" and your cosmic logo, I can create an even more thematically aligned color scheme:

## Trial Moderator
- **Color**: #4ac1ff (Nebula Blue)
- Represents the outer cosmic gases in your logo, perfect for those just starting their journey

## Moderator
- **Color**: #0070e0 (Deep Space Blue)
- A professional, deeper blue that represents the stability of established moderators

## Admin
- **Color**: #9966ff (Cosmic Purple)
- Draws from the vibrant purple energy fields in your logo, clearly distinguishing administrators

## Owner
- **Color**: #ff66d9 (Galactic Core Pink)
- Inspired by the bright center of your cosmic swirl, representing the core of your organization

This color scheme perfectly complements both your "GalacticDocs" name and your cosmic logo, creating a cohesive space theme throughout your server. The progression moves from the outer regions of your cosmic image toward the bright center, creating a natural hierarchy that users will intuitively understand.

These colors will make your support server look professional while maintaining the galactic theme, helping to strengthen your brand identity across both GitHub and Discord platforms.
